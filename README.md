# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This GitHub repository contains code for predicting breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle. The prediction is done using a logistic regression model, and the analysis includes data visualization using Seaborn and data manipulation using Pandas.

## Dataset

The [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes a total of 569 instances, each described by 30 numeric attributes. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Libraries Required

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
